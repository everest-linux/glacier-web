	<h2>Glacier</h2>
	<p>A source-based package manager with emphasis on scripting and manual packaging.</p>
	<h2>Advantages of Glacier</h2>
	<strong>Complete control over performance: </strong><p>Through customizable <cil>make</cil> options, programs can be optimized at compile time to run at peak performance.</p>
	<strong>Enhanced security: </strong><p>Unlike binary-based package managers, in which the user relies on upstream to fix vulnerabilities, Glacier packages can be patched by the user. Extra security features, such as stack-smashing protection, can be compiled as well. Additionally, Glacier tries to minimize connections to external servers by storing a local package database on the system.</p>
	<strong>Concise syntax: </strong><p>Glacier's command-line and package file syntax is designed to be concise and memorable.</p>
	<strong>Easy to package: </strong><p>Packaging software for Glacier is very easy, should you know shell scripting already. Simply create a package file, define its variables and functions, and you're all set.</p>
	<h2>Get Glacier</h2>
	<p>Glacier can be installed on any Linux system. While not tested, it likely works on the BSDs as well.</p>
